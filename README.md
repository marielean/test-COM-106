# test-COM-106

This repo acts as if it was "gov-it" or "peppol", so it has the role external repo which contains the openapi definition file.

The test is:

if the .redocly.yaml file in the developer portal project points to the openapi definition in THIS repo; if I update the definition in THIS repo, will that trigger a build of the portal and the api in the registry?
